# Style Guide: mc-adrian-lei.github.io

This document provides a style guide for all content on the `mc-adrian-lei.github.io` website. Its purpose is to ensure a consistent, professional, and empathic voice that accurately reflects the site's identity as a hub for trauma-informed systems design.

## 1. Professional Identity

The author and primary voice of the site should be consistently described as a **trauma-informed systems designer** or **developmental model architect**. This aligns with the professional branding on platforms like LinkedIn and accurately represents the interdisciplinary nature of the work.

## 2. Tone and Voice

The desired tone is a blend of academic precision and meta-therapeutic empathy. It should be:

- **Neuro-Psycho-Social:** Grounded in an understanding of the interplay between the brain, the mind, and social systems.
- **Empathic and Non-Pathologizing:** Human experiences should be framed with compassion, avoiding language that stigmatizes or medicalizes.
- **Systems-Level:** The focus should be on the interconnectedness of systems, from the individual to the societal.
- **Academically Precise:** When discussing technical concepts, use terminology from cognitive science, computational neuroscience, and developmental psychology.

## 3. Diction and Terminology

- **Clarity:** When introducing technical terms, pair them with brief, plain-language clarifications to ensure accessibility for a broad audience.
- **Consistency:** Use terms consistently throughout the site. For example, always use "neurosymbolic reasoning" rather than alternating with "hybrid AI."
- **Grounding:** Make clear distinctions between established research, emerging hypotheses, and personal frameworks. Use phrases like "inspired by," "supported by," or "emerging from" to signal the level of empirical support.

## 4. Tense, Person, and Reading Level

- **Tense:** Use the present tense when describing models and frameworks.
- **Person:** Use the first person ("I," "we") when describing the development of the work, especially in the context of the AI co-development narrative. Use the second person ("you") when providing guidance or reflective exercises for the reader.
- **Reading Level:** Write for an audience of advanced lay readers and practitioners. Assume a high level of intelligence and curiosity, but not necessarily a deep background in any specific academic field.

## 5. Citations and Sources

- **Preference:** When citing sources, prefer major journals (e.g., *Nature*, *Science*), universities (e.g., Stanford, MIT), and recognized research bodies (e.g., NCBI, NIH).
- **Format:** Include the full title of the paper or article, the author(s), the publication, and a direct URL. Footnotes or inline links are both acceptable, but should be used consistently within a page.
- **Purpose:** Citations should be used to ground claims in evidence and to provide readers with pathways for further exploration.

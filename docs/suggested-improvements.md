### Content & Clarity

1.  **Issue: Define "Dual-Channel Output" Upfront**
    -   **Summary:** The core concept of "Dual-Channel Output" is introduced in the title but not clearly defined until later. Add a concise, one-sentence definition at the beginning of the "Collaborative Development" section to ground the reader.

2.  **Issue: Explain "Three-Threaded Braiding"**
    -   **Summary:** The "Three-Threaded Braiding" concept is mentioned but not explained. Add a brief parenthetical or a short paragraph explaining the three threads: Structural Logic, Metabolic Cost, and Social Impact.

3.  **Issue: Add a Lay-Audience Definition of "Neurosymbolic Reasoning"**
    -   **Summary:** Provide a simple, accessible definition of "neurosymbolic reasoning" to make the site more welcoming to non-experts. This could be a short "What is...?" box.

4.  **Issue: Elaborate on the "Spider's Eight Eyes" Metaphor**
    -   **Summary:** The spider metaphor is a powerful hook. Add a sentence or two that explicitly connects the eight eyes to the concept of multi-threaded perception in the cognitive architecture.

5.  **Issue: Expand on "Ethical Anchors"**
    -   **Summary:** Briefly explain *how* the Icarus and Narcissus myths serve as ethical guardrails against AI hubris, connecting the metaphors to specific risks in AI development.

### Terminology & Diction

6.  **Issue: Replace Vague Phrases with Precise Terminology**
    -   **Summary:** Replace phrases like "knows itself" with more precise terms from cognitive science, such as "metacognitive self-monitoring." Similarly, rephrase "richer meaning" as "higher-dimensional semantic representation."

7.  **Issue: Introduce More Specific Academic Terminology**
    -   **Summary:** Incorporate terms like "cognitive synergy," "affective computing," and "computational models of narrative" where appropriate to align the text with current academic discourse.

### Structure & UX

8.  **Issue: Add a "Context & Related Work" Section**
    -   **Summary:** Create a new section that situates the project within the broader academic landscape, referencing related work in computational psychiatry, multi-scale modeling, and trauma-informed design.

9.  **Issue: Create a More Structured Introduction**
    -   **Summary:** Add a formal, abstract-style introduction that summarizes the project's goals, methods, and key contributions. This would provide a more traditional academic entry point to the content.

10. **Issue: Reorganize "The User's Vision Going Forward"**
    -   **Summary:** Restructure the "User's Vision" section into thematic subsections, such as "Research Directions," "Practical Applications," and "Community Goals," to improve clarity and organization.

### Citations & Grounding

11. **Issue: Add Citations for "Cognitive Architectures"**
    -   **Summary:** In the "Philosophical Touchstones" section, add citations to foundational papers for the SOAR and CLARION cognitive architectures.

12. **Issue: Provide a Source for "Dual-Process Theory"**
    -   **Summary:** Add a citation to a key work on Dual-Process Theory, such as Daniel Kahneman's "Thinking, Fast and Slow," to ground the concept in established research.

13. **Issue: Cite Research on "Embodied Cognition"**
    -   **Summary:** Add a citation to a foundational text or a comprehensive review article on embodied cognition to provide an entry point for readers unfamiliar with the field.

14. **Issue: Add a Citation for "Interpretability" in AI**
    -   **Summary:** Cite a well-known paper or survey on AI interpretability to connect the project's goals to the broader conversation in the field.

15. **Issue: Distinguish "Inspired by" vs. "Supported by"**
    -   **Summary:** Review the text and make a clear distinction between concepts that are "inspired by" established research and those that are "directly supported by" specific studies, to ensure intellectual honesty and clarity.

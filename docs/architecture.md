# Information Architecture: mc-adrian-lei.github.io

This document outlines the information architecture, core concepts, and target audience for the professional knowledge site of Adrian Lei Martinez Conol.

## 1. Overview

The site serves as a central hub for a collection of frameworks, models, and tools related to trauma-informed systems design, developmental psychology, and neurosymbolic AI. It aims to bridge the gap between theoretical research and applied practice, providing resources for practitioners, researchers, and individuals engaged in self-work.

The central metaphor of a "32-Aspect Developmental Self Clock" serves as an organizing principle for many of the concepts, which are explored through a combination of formal models and empathic, narrative-driven explanations.

## 2. Core Concepts

The site's content is built around a set of interconnected concepts:

- **Cognitive Architecture with Dual-Channel Output:** A model for AI systems that processes information through both symbolic (formal logic) and non-symbolic (narrative, intuitive) channels. This is the primary subject of the current `README.md`.
- **Neurosymbolic Reasoning:** The integration of neural network-based machine learning with symbolic reasoning to create more robust and interpretable AI.
- **Three-Threaded Braiding:** A decision-making framework that considers three dimensions: Structural Logic, Metabolic Cost, and Social Impact.
- **Trauma-Informed Systems:** The application of principles from trauma theory to the design of organizations, communities, and technological systems to make them more resilient and humane.
- **Developmental Psychology & Self-Work:** The use of developmental models (like the "32-Aspect Self Clock") as tools for personal growth and reflection.

## 3. Content Groups & Target Audience

The site's content can be organized into three main groups, each targeting a specific audience:

### a. For Practitioners
- **Content:** Field tools, protocols, and guides for applying the site's frameworks in clinical, coaching, or organizational settings.
- **Audience:** Therapists, coaches, consultants, and designers who need practical tools for their work.
- **Current Location:** Primarily described in the "User's Vision Going Forward" section of `README.md`.

### b. For Researchers
- **Content:** Theoretical models, formalizations, and conceptual maps that provide a deeper understanding of the underlying theories.
- **Audience:** Academics, students, and researchers in fields like cognitive science, computational neuroscience, and AI ethics.
- **Current Location:** The bulk of the current `README.md` falls into this category, with its focus on cognitive architectures and neurosymbolic reasoning.

### c. For Community & Self-Work
- **Content:** Reflective exercises, guides, and community resources for individuals interested in personal development and self-exploration.
- **Audience:** The general public and individuals on a self-work journey.
- **Current Location:** This is the least-developed area of the site, but the philosophical and ethical sections of `README.md` touch on these themes.
